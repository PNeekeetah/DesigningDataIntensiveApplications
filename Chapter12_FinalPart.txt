Doing The Right Thing

    -> All systems are built to fullfil a certain purpose, and every action has its
    own intended and unintended consequences

    -> Data may be an abstract thing, but t=it represents behaviours,
    interests and paterns of the consumers

    -> Technology is neither good or bad in itself, but the way we make use of it
    can determine it's ethical standpoint


    ## Predictive Analytics##

    - Is a major part of "Big Data"

    - It can be used either for 


    ##Bias and Discrimination##

    -> a decision made by an algorithm is not inherently better or worse
    than one done by a human

    ##Responsability and accountability##

    -> while a decision taken by a person has that individual accaountable for it,
    for algorithms this is not the case, still being a fairly gray area

    -> We might be able to make the case of the person/team/company that created the algorithm can be held accaountable
    for some predictive algorithms, it is not lways true, as for example, in ML. the algorithms are statistical models,
    driven by data, which might be or not biased, but the model can generate assumptions based on
    this data, which might unwillingly descriminate against some users, due to some sheer unlucky correlations in the data, 
    for which the creator of the algorithm can not be held accountable, as this unwilling behaviour is not part of his design


    ##Feedback Loops##

    -> Due to adaptivenes and perfectioning of predictive algorithms, there is a chance
    were they will start showing just what the user wants to see/agrees to
    
    NOTE: for some time now, there has been an introduction of randomnes in such algorithms to avoid this scenarios,
    but they can still happen, or show predominantly just what the user wants to see

    ##Privacy and Tracking##

    -> Due to descriptiveness characteristic of data, it can pose a privacy and ethical issue for
    users confidentiality

    ##Surveillance##

    -> Some data collection from iot devices is similar to total surveilance to which some
    users happily and eagerly oblige, providing an environment similar to an utopian totalitarian
    surveilnce ("wet dreams") similar to the world desribed in 1984 book by George Orwell


    ##Consent and Freedom of Choice##

    -> even though most apps provide consent forms and policies about what data
    is collected from the users and how it is processed, they are ussually unclear, vague or too technical for 
    the average user to understand, making a case for the disscusion of how meaningful is acctually the consent we 
    give to apps when engaging with their data collection. 

    -> the relationship between the service and the user is very asymmetric and one-
    sided, the terms are set by the service, not by the user

    ##Privacy and Use of Data##

    -> Even though the primary data which is provided by the users in some quantities depending on their 
    privacy settings, the secondary data, that comes from analyzing the primary data is not subject to the same 
    policy, rising a case of how private are our lives in this surveillance systems

    ##Data as assets and power##

    -> When a company goes bankrupt, the personal data it has collected is one of the assets that get sold.


    ##Legislation and Self-Regulation##

    -> while there are some legislations that are limitin the amount of data collected and processesed by companies,
    they haven't been necesarly kept up to date, becoming inherently less restrictve with todays technologies, suggesting
    that they might need to revised and or updated to better reflect todays concerns

    -> Companies that collect lots of data about people oppose regulation as being a burden
    and a hindrance to innovation. To some extent that opposition is justified. For exam‚Äê
    ple, when sharing medical data, there are clear risks to privacy, but there are also
    potential opportunities: how many deaths could be prevented if data analysis was
    able to help us achieve better diagnostics or find better treatments? Over-
    regulation may prevent such breakthroughs.
